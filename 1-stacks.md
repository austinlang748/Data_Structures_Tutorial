# Stacks
The stack is perhaps a lesser-known data structure characterized by the first in, last out principle. This refers to the order in which elements are added and removed, with the most recently added elements removed first, and the first elements removed last.  

There are software applications for which stacks are the clear container of choice. Some important examples are:

* Maintaining a history of actions, such as changes made to a text document
* Implementing a function stack (aka call stack) in software

We will discuss these in greater detail later on.

Stacks can easily be implemented in Python by creating a new list (i.e. `new_stack = []`) and using the built-in list operations. There is no special container type or keyword associated with stacks.  

After discussing these topics further, we will go over some example code which demonstrates the proper use of stacks. Additionally, you will be given a programming problem to solve on your own to test your knowledge.
